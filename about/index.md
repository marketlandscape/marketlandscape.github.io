# About

## Purpose


Market Landscape exists to provide a calmer way of looking at markets. Many decisions made by retail participants are shaped by pressure rather than analysis: fear during drawdowns, excitement near peaks, and constant noise in between. The aim here is to reduce that pressure by offering stable reference points instead of fast reactions.

## Approach

The tools published on this site focus on market context and positioning within broader cycles. They are designed to move slowly and to be read as ranges rather than precise signals. This is intentional. Excess precision and frequent updates often encourage unnecessary action, while slower frameworks support patience and proportional thinking.

## Framework

The primary framework developed within Market Landscape is the Market Navigation Index. It expresses market positioning on a 25-point contextual scale, describing where the market sits relative to its own historical structure rather than to absolute price levels. The index is intended as a reference tool for understanding cycle phases and regime transitions and functions as a contextual navigation model.

## Scope and limitations

This project is not a trading platform and does not provide financial or investment advice. Nothing published here is intended to indicate specific buying or selling decisions. The purpose is to help reduce common behavioral mistakes, such as panic-selling or buying into market euphoria, by anchoring interpretation in context rather than emotion.
