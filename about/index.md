# About

# Purpose

Market Landscape exists to reduce decision pressure in market interpretation. Periods of drawdowns and late-cycle advances often amplify emotional responses and reactive behaviour. The purpose of the project is to counter this by providing stable reference points that help frame market conditions without relying on short-term signals.

# Approach

The site uses slow-moving frameworks to describe market positioning within broader historical and cyclical structures. The core framework, the Market Navigation Index, expresses positioning on a 25-point scale relative to the market’s own cycle rather than absolute price levels. Tools are intended to be read directionally and as ranges, making regime shifts and risk–reward asymmetries visible while discouraging unnecessary precision and frequent action.

# Scope

Market Landscape is an interpretative framework, not a trading platform, and does not provide financial or investment advice. Its scope is cycle-level orientation and analysis, supporting understanding and focusing on structural market context.
