# About

## Purpose

This website exists to provide a calmer way of looking at markets. Many decisions made by retail participants are shaped by pressure rather than analysis: fear during drawdowns, excitement near peaks, and constant noise in between. The aim here is to reduce that pressure by offering stable reference points instead of fast reactions.

## Approach

The tools on this site focus on market context and positioning within broader cycles. They are designed to move slowly and to be read as ranges rather than precise signals. This is intentional. Excess precision and frequent updates often encourage unnecessary action, while slower frameworks support patience and proportional thinking.

## Scope

This is not a trading platform and not financial advice. Nothing here is meant to indicate specific buying or selling decisions. The purpose is to help avoid common behavioral mistakes, such as panic-selling or buying into market euphoria, by anchoring decisions in context rather than emotion.

## Maintenance

The project is developed and maintained independently, with emphasis on methodology, continuity, and long-term consistency.
