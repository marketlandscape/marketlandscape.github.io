# About

## Purpose

Market Landscape is intended to provide a calmer, context-oriented way of looking at markets, where decision pressure and behavioural distortions tend to increase during both drawdowns and late-cycle advances. Many decisions made by retail participants are shaped by pressure rather than analysis: fear, excitement, and constant noise in between. The goal is to reduce that pressure by offering stable reference points rather than fast reactions.

## Approach

The tools published on this site focus on market context and broad positioning within longer cycles. They are designed to move slowly and to be read as ranges, not precise signals. This is intentional. Excess precision and frequent updates often encourage unnecessary action, while slower frameworks support patience and proportional thinking.

## Framework

The primary framework developed within Market Landscape is the Market Navigation Index. It expresses market positioning on a 25-point contextual scale, describing where the market sits relative to its own historical and cyclical structure rather than to absolute price levels. At a higher level, Market Landscape functions as a strategic market navigation framework, providing cycle-level orientation and making regime and risk–reward asymmetries explicit without producing tactical signals or execution guidance.

## Scope and limitations

This project is not a trading platform and does not provide financial or investment advice. The purpose is to support interpretation, not execution, and to help reduce common behavioural errors by anchoring market reading in context rather than emotion.
