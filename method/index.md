# Method

## What the indexes represent  

They translate broad market conditions into a relative positioning scale designed to orient users within the market cycle. The scale provides a common reference framework for interpreting current conditions by situating them within their historical and cyclical structure.

## Cycle-first construction

Index construction is based on the market cycle structure. Cycle identification takes precedence over short-term volatility, local price patterns or isolated events. In crypto markets, cycle phase has consistently carried more durable information than high-frequency price behavior. Historical price behavior is used as an empirical reference set. Liquidity and monetary aggregates such as global M2 are included to assess cycle phases, allowing the index to reflect meaningful shifts. The scale also embeds ranges derived from historically observed outcomes under comparable market conditions, defining plausible envelopes.

## Interpretation and use

The scale functions as a decision-framing instrument. Rather than treating prices as isolated numerical facts, it positions current market conditions relative to where the market sits in a recurring cycle. Each part of the scale corresponds to a distinct risk–reward asymmetry, and the index makes these asymmetries visible. By anchoring interpretation, it supports more consistent strategic reasoning.
