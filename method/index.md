# Method

## What the indexes are – and are not

The indexes are not trading signals and not price-prediction models. They translate broad market conditions into a relative positioning scale. They describe where the market sits within its own historical structure, rather than attempting to forecast future price paths. Below are the core design principles.

## Market cycle priority

The phase of the market cycle takes precedence over short-term price fluctuations. In the crypto market, the structure of the cycle and the current regime often carry more informational value than daily volatility or isolated price movements.

## Role of historical price behavior

Historical price behavior provides useful signals, though it is not sufficient on its own to form a complete assessment. Past data serve as an empirical reference, helping to contextualize the current market state relative to previously observed price behaviour rather than to forecast future outcomes.

## Conservative use of price ranges

Any expected price ranges are intentionally constrained and non-speculative. Forecast-related elements are kept deliberately conservative to minimize the impact of narratives, noise and hype on index calculations.

## Structural adjustments

In addition to the primary cycle framework, macro-level adjustment layers may be applied when broader market conditions materially change. These layers refine positioning without overriding the core structure. Key examples include global M2 and related liquidity measures. 

## Adaptive structure

Market Navigator is designed as a dynamic model. As market structure evolves, the model incorporates information relevant to the market phase while preserving historical continuity. 

## Cycle-dependent interpretation

Interpretation depends on the identified market phase. The same numeric level may imply different risk characteristics in early expansion, late expansion, or contraction regimes. External phase identifiers ensure that readings are evaluated within the correct structural context.

## Summary

The method is intentionally context-first, conservative, and slow-moving. It prioritises cycle structure and strategic orientation over short-term responsiveness, providing a stable interpretive layer rather than a reactive decision mechanism.
