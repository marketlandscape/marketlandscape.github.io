# Method

## What the indexes represent  

They translate broad market conditions into a relative positioning scale designed to orient users within the market cycle. The scale provides a common reference framework for interpreting current conditions by situating them within their historical and cyclical structure.

## Cycle-first construction

Index construction is anchored in market cycle structure. Cycle identification takes precedence over short-term volatility, local price patterns or isolated events. In crypto markets, cycle phase has consistently carried more durable information than high-frequency price behavior. Historical price behavior is used as an empirical reference set. Liquidity and monetary aggregates such as global M2 are included to assess cycle phases, allowing the index to reflect meaningful shifts. The scale also embeds ranges derived from historically observed outcomes under comparable market conditions, defining plausible envelopes rather than expectations.

## Risk–reward asymmetries

Different regions of the scale imply structurally different risk–reward asymmetries. Early-cycle positioning has historically compressed downside while expanding optionality; late-cycle positioning tends to narrow upside while increasing fragility. The index makes these asymmetries visible.

## Interpretation and use

The practical role of the scale is decision framing within a cycle-based structure, reducing common contextual errors such as under-exposure early in the market cycle or over-commitment in later mature phases. By expressing market conditions through structured ranges, the scale links price levels to cycle positioning.
