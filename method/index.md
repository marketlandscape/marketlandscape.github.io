# Design & Logic

The indexes are intentionally not trading signals and not price-prediction models. They are designed to translate broad market conditions into a relative positioning scale.

The design rests on three principles.

First, market phase outweighs short-term price movement. Cycle structure and prevailing market regimes take priority over daily volatility and local price noise.

Second, price behaviour offers context, not certainty. Recent price action serves as an empirical reference point rather than a mechanism for forecasting future moves.

Third, forward expectations are deliberately constrained. Any forward-looking element is conservative by design, bounded to reduce narrative influence and speculative bias.

The indexes may inform directional positioning but do not attempt execution-level timing. The logic prioritises stability over responsiveness. Values evolve slowly by intent, reinforcing a predefined long-term framework while limiting reactions to emotionally driven market sentiment.
