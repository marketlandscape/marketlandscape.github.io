# Design & Logic

The indexes are intentionally not trading signals and not price-prediction models. They are designed to translate broad market conditions into a relative positioning scale.

The design combines three ideas:

**Market phase matters more than short-term price moves**: the indexes prioritise cycle structure and regime context over daily local volatility.

**Recent price behaviour is informative, but incomplete**: observed price action is used as an empirical anchor, not as a forecasting engine.

<strong>Forward expectations are constrained, not speculative</strong>: any forward-looking component is deliberately conservative and bound to avoid narrative-driven bias.

The indexes may inform directional positioning but they do not aim to time trades with execution-level precision. The logic emphasises stability over reactivity. Values change slowly by design, supporting a predefined long-term strategy while limiting reactions to emotionally driven market sentiment.
