# Method

## What the indexes are – and are not

The indexes are not trading signals and not price-prediction models. They translate broad market conditions into a relative positioning scale. They describe where the market sits within its own historical structure, rather than attempting to forecast future price paths. Below are the core design principles.

## 1. Market phase over short-term noise

Cycle structure and regime context dominate interpretation. Daily and weekly volatility is intentionally down-weighted to prevent local price fluctuations from distorting structural positioning.

## 2. Price as an anchor, not a forecast

Recent price behaviour is used empirically. It anchors the framework to observed market reality, but is never treated as a predictive engine or extrapolated into future expectations.

## 3. Constrained forward expectations

Any forward-looking component is deliberately conservative and bounded. The method avoids narrative amplification, trend extrapolation, and speculative bias, especially in emotionally charged market phases.

## 4. Positioning, not execution

The indexes inform directional positioning across market cycles. They do not attempt trade-level timing, entry optimisation, or execution precision.

## 5. Stability over reactivity

Index values evolve slowly by design. Persistence is favoured over responsiveness to sharp moves, supporting long-horizon strategies and reducing sensitivity to sentiment-driven market swings.

## 6. Structural adjustments

In addition to the primary cycle framework, explicit macro-level adjustment layers are applied when broader conditions materially change. These layers fine-tune positioning without overriding the core structure.

Key examples include:
- Global M2 and related liquidity aggregates, used to contextualise expansionary or contractionary liquidity regimes.
- Macro regime indicators, capturing shifts in monetary or financial conditions.
- Structural stress or compression measures, reflecting system-level pressure rather than asset-specific moves.

These inputs operate as secondary constraints. They adjust the positioning range only when sustained macro divergence is observed.

## 7. Adaptive, path-dependent structure

Market Navigator is designed as a dynamic framework rather than a fixed model. As market structure evolves, the framework may incorporate new regime-relevant information, while preserving historical continuity. Adjustments are selective and constrained. They are introduced only when broader market structure changes in a way that materially affects interpretation, rather than in response to short-term conditions.

Two characteristics define this process:
Continuity over replacement: updates refine the existing structure instead of resetting it, ensuring that historical positioning remains interpretable over time.
Path dependence: changes accumulate gradually, allowing the framework to adapt without abrupt shifts in behaviour or meaning.

As a result, positioning values reflect not only current market data, but also the evolving understanding of which factors matter structurally at each stage of the market cycle.

## Cycle-dependent interpretation

Positioning values are not absolute. Interpretation depends on the identified market phase. The same numeric level may imply different risk characteristics in early expansion, late expansion, or contraction regimes. External phase identifiers ensure that readings are evaluated within the correct structural context.

## Summary

The method is intentionally context-first, conservative, and slow-moving. It prioritises cycle structure and strategic orientation over short-term responsiveness, providing a stable interpretive layer rather than a reactive decision mechanism.
