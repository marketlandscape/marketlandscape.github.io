# Method

## What the indexes represent  

This page explains how the navigation indexes are constructed and what their values represent. The indexes express market conditions as a relative, normalised position within a recurring market cycle. Rather than measuring absolute price levels, they describe where the market sits in relation to its own historical range and structural phases. This creates a common reference scale for interpreting different assets and market segments within the same contextual framework.

## Cycle-first construction

Index construction follows a cycle-first approach, where identification of the prevailing market regime takes precedence over short-term volatility, local price patterns or isolated events. In crypto markets, the cycle phase has historically carried more persistent information than high-frequency price behaviour. Historical price behaviour is used as an empirical reference set to define relative positioning across phases. Broader liquidity and monetary indicators, such as global M2, are incorporated to support cycle identification and to capture shifts that tend to precede or accompany major regime transitions.

## Interpretation and use

The scale is designed as a decision-framing instrument, not a signal generator. Each region of the scale corresponds to a distinct risk–reward asymmetry derived from historical behaviour across cycles. By translating market conditions into a bounded contextual position, the index helps anchor interpretation and reduce behavioural bias supporting more consistent long-term strategic reasoning.
