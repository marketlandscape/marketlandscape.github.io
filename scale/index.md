# Scale

The index uses a 1–25 scale organised into five zones, designed to describe market conditions within a broader market cycle rather than fine-grained timing. The scale is read directionally and comparatively, with emphasis on regime context. The five zones are defined below. 

1–5 — favorable — historically strong risk–reward conditions, where downside is more contained and conditions have tended to favour patient positioning.

6–10 — improving — conditions are strengthening; participation and confidence build gradually.  

11–15 — neutral — risk and reward are more balanced; outcomes become increasingly sensitive to positioning and time horizon.  

16–20 — elevated risk — conditions become stretched; sensitivity to volatility and adverse moves rises.  

21–25 — excess — increasingly speculative environments where fragility dominates despite strong narratives.  

On the altcoin scale, these zones are expressed through practical positioning labels that mirror this progression: entry, scale in, hold, scale out and exit. 

Within this structure, each zone spans five positions, which indicate how mature the current environment is. Early values reflect entry into a zone, mid-zone values typically capture consolidation or digestion where conditions persist without directional progress, and later values signal increasing proximity to a transition into the next zone.

For Bitcoin, the same structural scale is applied, with upper-zone labels adjusted to reflect its distinct long-term role. Rather than emphasising reduction or exit, later stages describe sustained conviction and long-term holding, indicating environments where structural ownership has historically been maintained under elevated volatility, with an expectation of significant short-term drawdowns. These labels describe positioning tendencies under specific market regimes, not prescriptive holding behaviour.
