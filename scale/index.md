# Scale

The index uses a 1–25 scale organised into five zones, designed to describe market conditions within a broader cycle rather than fine-grained timing. The scale is read directionally and comparatively, with emphasis on regime context. The five zones: 

- Favorable (1–5) — historically strong risk–reward conditions, where downside is more contained and conditions have tended to favour patient positioning.
- Improving (6–10) — conditions are strengthening; participation and confidence build gradually.
- Neutral (11–15) — risk and reward are more balanced; outcomes become increasingly sensitive to positioning and time horizon.
- Elevated Risk (16–20) — conditions become stretched; sensitivity to volatility and adverse moves rises.
- Excess (21–25) — increasingly speculative environments where fragility dominates despite strong narratives. 

On the altcoin scale, these zones are expressed through practical positioning labels that mirror this progression: entry, scale in, hold, reduce, and exit. 

Within this structure, each zone spans five positions, which indicate how mature the current environment is. Early values reflect entry into a zone, mid-zone values typically capture consolidation or digestion where conditions persist without directional progress, and later values signal increasing proximity to a transition into the next zone.

For Bitcoin, the same structural scale is used, though the upper-zone labels are framed differently to reflect its distinct role. Instead of reduce and exit, the later stages emphasise conviction and HODL, aligning with the never sell your Bitcoin long-term holding principle across cycles.
