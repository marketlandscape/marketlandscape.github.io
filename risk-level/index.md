# Risk level

## What the risk level measures

Risk level expresses situational downside risk in the current market context. It answers a practical question: if Bitcoin were to experience a drawdown on the order of 30% from current levels, how severe could the downside be for a given asset or asset class under current conditions? It is not a probability estimate, not a volatility measure, and not a trading signal. It describes the degree of downside amplification in stress conditions. The risk level is a complementary indicator that adds downside severity context to the navigation index and sharpens its interpretation. For most of the market cycle, the risk level evolves gradually, and as market resilience declines, it increases non-linearly, shifting attention away from short-term price noise toward the potential depth of downside moves.

## Bitcoin as the stress anchor

Bitcoin functions both as an asset within the framework and as its reference point. For Bitcoin itself, the risk level reflects the depth of drawdowns that have historically occurred prior to durable recoveries. Declines on the order of 20–30% represent typical stress events observed across multiple phases of the cycle, while deeper drawdowns in the 40–60% range tend to occur near inflection points and transitional phases. This observed behavior serves as the foundation for the entire risk scale.

## Risk level ranges by asset class

Downside risk is structurally uneven across crypto assets. Each asset class operates within a bounded downside envelope:  

Bitcoin: 15–60%  
Ethereum: 25–70%  
Large-cap altcoins: 35–80%  
Mid-cap assets: 50–90%  
Small-cap assets: 65–95%  
Micro-cap assets: 80–99%  

When Bitcoin declines, assets with lower liquidity and higher sensitivity to capital outflows tend to fall more sharply and more rapidly. Under comparable Bitcoin drawdowns, Ethereum has historically experienced deeper declines than Bitcoin, while altcoins have repeatedly experienced drawdowns in the 35–99% range, particularly in later stages of the cycle. These ranges describe structural downside capacity under stress, not isolated events.
