# Risk level

## Purpose of the risk level indicator

Risk level expresses situational downside risk in the current market context.  It answers a practical question: if Bitcoin were to experience a meaningful drawdown (on the order of about 30%) from current levels, how severe could the downside be for a specific asset or asset class under current market conditions? It is not probability, not volatility, and not a trading signal. It describes downside amplification under stress, rather than predicting price movements.

## Why different assets have different baseline risk

Different coin classes carry different baseline risks by design. This reflects a persistent and observable feature of crypto markets: assets with lower liquidity and smaller market capitalization fall more, and faster, when Bitcoin weakens. As a result, risk is inherently uneven across asset classes even when the same Bitcoin move is used as the reference shock.

## Bitcoin as anchor and reference  

Bitcoin serves both as an asset within the framework and as the reference point for it. For Bitcoin, risk level measures timing downside risk: the size of a drawdown from the current price that is historically plausible before the next durable recovery. Historically, a Bitcoin pullback of around 30% is a normal stress event that occurs in many phases of the cycle, while deeper declines of 40 to 60% tend to appear near major cycle transitions.  This observed behavior anchors the entire scale.

## How risk for other assets is expressed  

Risk levels for other assets are expressed relative to Bitcoin stress. When Bitcoin falls by roughly 30%, Ethereum has historically tended to fall more than Bitcoin, often on the order of 35 to 50%. Large-cap altcoins typically experience deeper declines under the same conditions, frequently in the 45 to 60% range, as liquidity thins and capital rotates out.

## Why lower-cap assets dominate the upper end  

Lower-cap assets amplify Bitcoin downside most aggressively. In comparable Bitcoin drawdowns, mid-cap altcoins have often fallen by 60 to 75%, while small-cap altcoins have repeatedly suffered losses of 70 to 90% or more, especially near late-cycle and post-peak conditions. These outcomes are not rare tail events but recurring patterns across cycles, which is why lower-cap assets occupy the extreme end of the risk spectrum.

## How the risk level is calculated in practice  

In practical terms, risk level combines structural sensitivity - how strongly an asset class has historically reacted to Bitcoin drawdowns - with current market conditions - how stretched, crowded, and reflexive positioning appears. Risk tends to remain relatively stable through much of the cycle and increases non-linearly as conditions deteriorate, keeping the measure focused on context and severity rather than short-term price noise.
