# Risk level

## What the risk level measures

Risk level expresses situational downside risk in the current market context. It answers a practical question: if Bitcoin were to experience a drawdown on the order of 30% from current levels, how severe could the downside be for a given asset or asset class under current conditions? It is not a probability estimate, not a volatility measure, and not a trading signal. It describes the degree of downside amplification in stress conditions. The risk level is a complementary indicator that adds downside severity context to the navigation index and sharpens its interpretation. For most of the market cycle, the risk level evolves gradually, and as market resilience declines, it increases non-linearly, shifting attention away from short-term price noise toward the potential depth of downside moves.

## Bitcoin as the stress anchor

Bitcoin serves both as an asset within the framework and as its reference point. For Bitcoin itself, risk level reflects timing-related downside: the magnitude of drawdowns that have historically occurred before durable recoveries. Pullbacks of around 30% are common across many cycle phases, while deeper declines in the 40–60% range tend to cluster near major cycle transitions. This observed behavior anchors the entire risk scale.

## Structural risk differences across assets

Risk is structurally uneven across crypto assets. When Bitcoin weakens, assets with lower liquidity and smaller market capitalization tend to fall more, and faster. Under comparable Bitcoin drawdowns, Ethereum has historically declined more than Bitcoin, large-cap altcoins more than Ethereum, and lower-cap assets most aggressively. Mid- and small-cap altcoins have repeatedly experienced losses of 60–90% or more in similar stress events, particularly in late-cycle conditions.
