# Risk level

## What the risk level measures

Risk level expresses situational downside risk in the current market context. It answers a practical question: if Bitcoin were to experience a drawdown on the order of 30% from current levels, how severe could the downside be for a given asset or asset class under current conditions? It is not a probability estimate, not a volatility measure, and not a trading signal. It describes downside amplification under stress rather than forecasting price movements.

## Bitcoin as the stress anchor

Bitcoin serves both as an asset within the framework and as its reference point. For Bitcoin itself, risk level reflects timing-related downside: the magnitude of drawdowns that have historically occurred before durable recoveries. Pullbacks of around 30% are common across many cycle phases, while deeper declines in the 40–60% range tend to cluster near major cycle transitions. This observed behavior anchors the entire risk scale.

## Structural risk differences across assets

Risk is structurally uneven across crypto assets. When Bitcoin weakens, assets with lower liquidity and smaller market capitalization tend to fall more, and faster. Under comparable Bitcoin drawdowns, Ethereum has historically declined more than Bitcoin, large-cap altcoins more than Ethereum, and lower-cap assets most aggressively. Mid- and small-cap altcoins have repeatedly experienced losses of 60–90% or more in similar stress events, particularly in late-cycle conditions. 

## How the risk level is formed

In practice, risk level combines two elements: structural sensitivity — how strongly an asset or asset class has historically responded to Bitcoin drawdowns — and current market conditions. Risk typically remains relatively stable through much of the cycle and rises non-linearly as conditions deteriorate, keeping the indicator focused on severity and context rather than short-term price noise.
